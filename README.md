## Hi there 👋

<!--
**Alexchaser/Alexchaser** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Hi! I'm currently studying **Cybersecurity** through an online course and building hands-on skills in **network security, ethical hacking, and digital forensics**. I’m passionate about learning how systems break so I can help secure them.

### 🚀 Current Focus

* Studying: `Intro to Cybersecurity`, `Network Fundamentals`, `Linux Essentials`
* Labs: Virtual machines, packet sniffing, Wireshark analysis
* Tools: `Wireshark`, `Nmap`, `Metasploit`, `Kali Linux`
